This project is a Mortgage Backed Securities System designed to help users search, package, and manage mortgage loans. The backend is built with Java and Spring Boot, connecting to a PostgreSQL database for secure data storage and retrieval. The frontend is developed using React, providing an interactive interface for features such as mortgage searching, loan packaging, and dashboard analytics.
